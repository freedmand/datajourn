    <h1>Sketch Assignment</h1>
    <p>
      <em>Due Monday, September 23, 2019</em>
    </p>
    <p>This project will mirror the in-class exercise, but now on data relating to your project pitch.</p>
    <p>Find a dataset or multiple datasets that are relevant to your project pitch. Import those datasets into Google Sheets and pull out interesting statistics. Your task is to sketch a visualization about this dataset on a piece of paper. You can use Google Sheets’ charting tools to get an idea of the proportions to draw, but I don’t want you to be limited or influenced too much by how Google Sheets does things.</p>
    <p>There may be data you wish you had but that you can’t fully find, or some missing stats that would supplement the data and should be out there. Feel free to make up fictitious data if this is the case, so long as you do a realistic job portraying how it may look and have an understanding that it could be possible to obtain.</p>
    <p>Share the Google Sheets with me, send me an email with a photo of your sketch, and write-up a paragraph blurb about the process (open-ended, but you may want to talk about finding the data, what you learned sketching vs. just hitting “Insert Chart”).</p>
    <p>For extra credit, create your visualization in Figma as well and send me a link.</p>

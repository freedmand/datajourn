    <h1>Class 6: Records, Pitches, Design</h1>
    <p>In this class we’ll do a few really different things! First, we’ll go over project pitches, then we’ll file FOIA requests on MuckRock with the FBI for files related to them. Finally, we’ll start tackling visual design and go over some slides. Time-permitting, I’ll introduce you to Figma, a powerful design tool.</p>

    <h2>Project pitches</h2>
    <p>At this point, you all should have your project pitches turned in. Some of you don’t. That’s ok. We’ll have roughly half the class present pitches today and workshop them a bit in class.</p>
    <h2>Filing that FOIA request with the FBI</h2>
    <p>You’ve been waiting all weekend. Now, we can finally file the FOIA request.</p>
    <p>Steps:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Go to accounts.muckrock.com and click through to sign up for a free plan</li>
      <li>Once you’ve signed up, send me an email at freedmand@temple.edu with the email address you used to sign up. I’ll then send an email invite for you to join the Temple Data Journalism organization I created on MuckRock. This will let you file requests for free.</li>
      <li>
        Once you receive that email, click on the link in the email and choose
        <em>Accept</em> to join the organization.
      </li>
      <li>
        Now go to muckrock.com &mdash; if you are not already signed in, click on
        <em>Sign In</em> at the top, and it should remember your details.
      </li>
      <li>Click on “File a Request”</li>
      <li>Take a look at all the different fields you need to fill out... A bit overwhelmed? Near the top it should say “Out of ideas? Try cloning a request.” Click on that to start a FOIA request with someone else’s template.</li>
      <li>
        Browse the possible requests to clone. Which one looks like something we’d want to do? Click on
        <em>Clone</em> once you find a relevant request.
      </li>
      <li>Now look at the filled in fields. Change the title to reflect the person you wish to FOIA.</li>
      <li>
        Change the main text of the body of the request to explain who this person is, briefly and concisely. An example template:
        <blockquote>
          A copy of FBI files on
          <code>person’s full name</code>,
          <code>summary of person</code>, whose death was widely reported in the media on
          <code>date</code>.
        </blockquote>Be sure to be as specific as possible. Steve Jobs doesn’t need as much of an introduction, but for someone less famous it helps to add links to articles with that person’s obituary in the media. For example, here’s the language used on a request for Mac Miller:
        <blockquote>A copy of all documents or FBI files pertaining to Mac Miller, an obituary of whom was published in The New York Times on September 7, 2018 under the headline "Mac Miller, Rapper Who Wrestled With Fame and Addiction, Dies at 26". Please see attached PDF copy of that obituary, which may also be found at https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/07/arts/music/mac-miller-dead.html.</blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>
        Once you’re ready, hit
        <em>Submit</em> below to send your request to the FBI. Congrats! You will hopefully receive a response from the FBI within a few weeks. (Note: if you really don’t want to, you don’t have to submit the request. You can just hit save and show me the filled in request, leaving it unsubmitted)

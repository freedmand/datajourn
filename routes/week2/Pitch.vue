    <h1>Project Pitch</h1>
    <p>
      <em>Due Monday, September 16</em>
    </p>
    <p>Come up with a pitch for a story you’d be interested in reporting on using data. The story can be Philly-specific or national.</p>
    <p>The pitch should be a short paragraph</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Answer the
        <em>what</em>,
        <em>where</em>,
        <em>who</em>,
        <em>how</em>, and
        <em>why</em>. What is your story about? Where is it based? Who are the major people involved? How is this happening? And, the most important,
        <em>why</em> &mdash; why now? (What makes this story newsworthy)
      </li>
      <li>List potential datasets or other data sources</li>
      <li>List potential other sources, e.g. people to interview, agencies to reach out to, etc.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This will be the start of an independent reporting project students will work on throughout the semester. Start brainstorming project ideas now. The pitch will inform what you report on, but if you need or want to change things up later on, that’s ok.</p>

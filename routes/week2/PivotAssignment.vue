    <h1>Pivot Tables Assignment</h1>
    <p>
      <em>Due Tuesday, September 10</em>
    </p>
    <p>This assignment will resemble the first week’s:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Pull any dataset of your choosing. You can find data on
        <a
          href="https://www.opendataphilly.org/dataset"
        >OpenDataPhilly</a>, use your dataset from the first week, or find some new data somewhere (for instance
        <a
          href="https://www.data.gov/"
        >data.gov</a> has interesting national level data).
      </li>
      <li>Import the data into Google Sheets.</li>
      <li>Make a pivot table from the data with a row grouping and a column grouping (some datasets don’t lend themselves well to this, so you may have to search for another if it doesn’t work out well).</li>
      <li>Share the Google Sheet to freedmand@temple.edu and also email me a short paragraph on what you found out / what’s interesting about the pivot table.</li>
      <li>Extra credit: In the Google Sheet, make a chart from the pivot table data. Give the chart a meaningful title.</li>
    </ul>

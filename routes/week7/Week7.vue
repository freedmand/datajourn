    <h1>Week 7: Halfway There</h1>
    <p>In this week, roughly halfway through the semester, we are going to take a step back and look at all we’ve accomplished. What have we learned? How is it useful? How can it be applied to data journalism tasks going forward?</p>
    <p>We’ll also figure out future directions, based on what you want to invest more effort into. Data analysis, design, web programming, interactivity, joining datasets &mdash; and so on.</p>
    <p>Thursday’s class we’re going to divide into random teams to tackle an in-depth, in-class exercise collaboratively. Stay tuned!</p>

    <h1>Sending a FOIA for FBI files</h1>
    <p>
      <a href="http://2016.padjo.org/assignments/first-fbi-foia/">Copying the homework from here</a>. Take a look through that page for ideas on filing a FOIA request with the FBI. Your homework due Thursday is to just identify a deceased famous person you would like to FOIA. The person must not have already been FOIA’d to the best of your knowledge (search Google and MuckRock and make sure no one’s done it). We will file the requests next week.

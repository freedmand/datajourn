    <ul>
      <li>The bars in the graph must be proportional to the data</li>
      <li>
        You must include text you add yourself (with a font thatâ€™s not the default,
        <em>Roboto</em>)
      </li>
      <li>Your graph must have some non-grayscale color to it</li>
      <li>Send me a short paragraph to my email describing what design principles were utilized, and what challenges if any you encountered using Figma.</li>

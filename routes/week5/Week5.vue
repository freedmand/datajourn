    <h1>Week 5</h1>
    <p>This week we’ll get much more acquainted with Figma, the design tool you’ve all installed but are itching to learn more about. In addition to learning more how to use the tool, we’ll see how visualizations in other formats, e.g. from Google Sheets, can be imported into Figma and then customized.</p>

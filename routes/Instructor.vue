    <h1>About the instructor</h1>
    <h3>Dylan Freedman</h3>
    <p>I am the lead developer for a project called DocumentCloud, co-founded by fellow Klein College professor Aron Pilhofer. Every day the tool I work on helps thousands of journalists upload, analyze, annotate, and share primary source documents, such as the leaked telegram chats from the former governor of Puerto Rico and the Mueller Report. In undergraduate, I was a double-major in computer science and music at Harvard. I went on to work for Google in California as a software engineer, working with a team to help computers understand everyday sounds and noises with machine learning. After two years, I decided to pivot to journalism, due to a desire to interact with human stories and apply computation to help journalists at scale. I did a one-year Masterâ€™s program at Stanford in journalism and then moved to Philadelphia to work at DocumentCloud. I grew up in Carmel Valley, CA and enjoy casual sprinting and playing piano.</p>

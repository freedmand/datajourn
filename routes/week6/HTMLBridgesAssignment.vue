    <p>
      Go to
      <a href="https://bridges.datajourn.com/">bridges.datajourn.com</a> and solve all the exercises. At the end, you will receive a secret code unique to your computer. Email that code to me at freedmand@temple.edu &mdash; if you get stuck, also feel free to email me for advice.
    </p>
    <p>
      For additional practice, feel free to start creating a personal portfolio for yourself in HTML. This will be an assignment at a later date. You can mess around with
      <a
        href="https://codepen.io/pen/"
      >Codepen</a>, a free online code editor, to try having more fun with HTML and web technologies yourself. (This is all optional and not part of this assignment.)

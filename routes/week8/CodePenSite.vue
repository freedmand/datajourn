      Good riddance, CodePen! While providing a good service for quick templating, we are now working with a heavy duty code editor,
      <a
        href="https://webwarrior.netlify.com"
      >WebWarrior</a>!
    </p>
    <p>In this homework, you will simply convert the site you already made in CodePen to an actual site and put it on Netlify.</p>
    <p>Requirements:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Copy your site over from CodePen to WebWarrior. Iâ€™d recommend following the example in WebWarrior on how to include stylesheets and putting the HTML in the
        <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> section of the document and the styles in a CSS file.
      </li>
      <li>Fix up any syntax errors you may have and format the code.</li>
      <li>Deploy it to Netlify!</li>
      <li>
        Go into the
        <a href="https://app.netlify.com">Netlify app</a> and give your site a better name.
      </li>
      <li>Email the published website URL to me at freedmand@temple.edu</li>
    </ul>
